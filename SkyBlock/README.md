# SkyBlock

![](Skyblock_Island.webp "SkyBlock Island")

## Introduction

**Skyblock** is one of the most popular survival gamemodes. The gamemode is about creating and expanding your very own world infinitely with only minimal materials. You start on a small island floating in the middle of void with a few basic items and a single tree. You  must survive and expand this island. You must learn to use and preserve your materials wisely, since each material has a strategic use, and wasting any of them could be disastrous. For example, lava buckets have a *very* important use! You need to also know the basics of Minecraft in order to complete challenges and expand. 

It is normal to make mistakes, that may even require restarts, when you just start playing.

## Teams

Teams are a way for multiple players to collaborate on a single island. team commands are [`/is team`](#team).

### Team Roles

1. Coop
2. Trusted
3. Member
4. Sub-Owner
5. Owners

## Greenhouses

Greenhouses are made out of glass and must contain the blocks found in the Biome Recipe to be valid. There is a recipe GUI accessed using `/is greenhouses`. Once built, the greenhouse can be used to grow plants with bonemeal, and it may spawn biome-specific mobs. If you include a hopper with water in it, snow will form inside the greenhouse when it rains. If you put bonemeal in the hopper, biome-specific plants will grow. Some blocks can also transform over time due to "erosion".

### How to make one?


1. Make glass blocks and build a rectangular set of walls with a flat roof.
2. Put a hopper in the wall or roof.
3. Put a door in the wall, so you can get in and out.
4. Type `/island greenhouses` and read the rules for the greenhouse you want.
5. Exit the GUI and place blocks, water, lava, and ice so that you make your desired biome.
6. Type `/island greenhouses` again and click on the biome to make it.
7. Type `/island greenhouses` help to see other options.

### How to use it?

- Use bonemeal to grow small plants on grass blocks immediately in the greenhouse.
- Or place bonemeal in the hopper to have the greenhouse sprinkle bonemeal automatically. Come back later to see what grows!
- Place a bucket of water (or more) in the hopper to cause snow to fall in cold biomes. Snow will fall when it rains in the world. Each snowfall empties one bucket of water.
- Friendly biome-specific mobs may spawn in your greenhouse - the usual rules apply (be more than 24 blocks away).
