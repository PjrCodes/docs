# SkyBlock

![](Skyblock_Island.webp "SkyBlock Island")

## Introduction

**Skyblock** is one of the most popular survival gamemodes. The gamemode is about creating and expanding your very own world infinitely with only minimal materials. You start on a small island floating in the middle of void with a few basic items and a single tree. You  must survive and expand this island. You must learn to use and preserve your materials wisely, since each material has a strategic use, and wasting any of them could be disastrous. For example, lava buckets have a *very* important use! You need to also know the basics of Minecraft in order to complete challenges and expand. 

It is normal to make mistakes, that may even require restarts, when you just start playing.

## Fly

## Biomes

**Biomes** allow the user to change the biome on their island.

You need to buy biomes using the [`/is biomes`](#biomes) command. You can then apply the biome on the same menu.

### Working

Choose a biome form the list. Choose how large area is affected and apply it. After that, in the area, the biome is changed. But due to the minecraft structure, it is possible, that players need to unload the area (easiest, go to other's island, and then come back), for seeing the effect.
