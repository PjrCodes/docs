## Rules and Guidelines

### Rule Of Thumb

All the following rules can be summarised simply, in one line. "Be kind to others on the server". This server follows a Honor Code, and we expect everyone to respect each other. Disrespect is actionable upon. We want to ensure a safe and friendly experience for everyone, and this is not possible without your co-operation. We kindly request you to follow all these rules and keep everything playful and fun.

### Detailed Rules and Guidelines

1. **No Griefing Policy**: Griefing is not tolerated at all. If you are caught, you will be **banned** from Derpitcraft Season 9 indefinitely. Our moderators will decide a suitable punishment. Griefing also includes stealing items from other players, destroying their bases, structures, and farms, and causing deaths/ killing players (The PvP policy is explained in **Pt.2**). It includes *harmful* pranking. Read more about the pranking policy in **Pt.3**. For a better idea on what consists of a player's base, structure, or farm, see **Pt.4**.

    To report griefing, or a player in any other condition, read the **Reporting** section of the **How To Guide**.

2.  **PvP Policy**: PvP is not permitted on the server except under specific conditions. PvP includes killing a player's pet, and damaging the player in any way, including but not limited to: using TNT, using weapons, using bows, using crossbows, using potions, and using pets. 

    - *PvP is permitted for self-defense*: If someone else attacks first, you can PvP to defend yourself. Don't escalate a fight for self-defense by using a better weapon. This is likely to make things worse. If it is a fist fight, try to resolve it peacefully without weapons at all. We do not recommend PvP to defend your base, structures, or farms. If someone is actively griefing your base, report the player *immediately* (see **Reporting**), and try to make the other party stop using the *chat*.
   
    - *PvP is permitted with consent*: If two or more players agree to PvP, they can PvP based on their own internal terms. We will not intervene unless a player is reported or griefing is detected. If both parties agree, you can have playful fights, kill the other party, and even make arena's for the entire server to enjoy.
   
    PvP fights and discrepancies are judged on a case to case basis, and an investigation will take place if a report is raised. This policy extends to harming players in any way.

3. **Pranking Policy**: Harmful pranks are not allowed. Harmless pranks are allowed and encouraged to create a fun experience for all players. Harmful pranking includes pranks that cause deaths, damage to items, and loss of items. Don't play pranks which won't be taken lightly. Try to judge this based on the player you are pranking. Try to take all kinds of harmless pranks in a light and fun manner. If you prank someone in a way that makes them die, or lose items, you are responsible for the items and need to return them within an hour. If you can't return them, then it will be counted as griefing. Always try to use common sense, and don't do pranks that can't be reversed. Think before pranking. If you don't want to be pranked at all, you can explicitly tell players to not prank you. If they don't respect your decision, report them, and we will take action. 

4. **Land Claim Policy**: Claiming land is done through mutual respect. Do not make bases near other players/ teams. Give each player respectable space, and leave space for them to expand. You can lay "claims" to land for farms, structures, and land for bases. You can claim land by writing your name on a sign, and placing it in an area. You can also mark an area with a border. Further, you can use the **dccoordinates** command to announce your claim on Discord (Read the **Coordinates and Claims** how to guide). It is recommended to check #ds9-coordinates to see if an area is not already claimed. You can't claim strongholds. The stronghold, once found, is **community property** and anyone is free to use it. You can claim villages, though it is encouraged to spare/ lend a few villagers for your fellow players so they can make their own breeders. Raise a report if someone has settled too close to you. This doesn't apply to claims on the Shopping District Island (See **Pt.5**). 

5. **Shopping District Policy**: Like Hermitcraft, Derpitcraft has a *Shopping District* (SD). It is the centrally located Mooshroom Island located at the coordinates given above. It is a place where all players can create community *shops* to trade items for services or other items You **cannot** break blocks or build on the shopping district, **unless** you are building a shop (or you are stuck!). You have to **pay** to claim land in the SD. The SD is a place where griefing is strictly denied. There will be heavy consequences to rule breaking in the SD.

   - *Plots in the SD*: You can buy "plots" of land in the SD. These plots are shaped as any simple geometric shape or a combination of them. The suggested shape for a shop is a **square** or **rectangle**. Making multiple shops on the same plot is frowned upon, but not strictly denied. You can buy multiple plots and merge them together for larger shops.
   - *Paying for plots*: Payment is done by placing **one diamond block** on the pedestal in the shopping district. **One diamond block** buys you a plot of **144 blocks** in size. This payment is **not refundable**. You can start building on the SD after you have paid. Once you pay, you can mark your shop's area using a border.
   
       **WARNING**: You **CANNOT** break blocks once you place them on the pedestal, so **DONT PLACE ANY OTHER BLOCK**. Raise a ticket if you make a mistake.

   - *Other details*: Plots **can** be asked to be by moderators if deemed necessary. They **cannot** be within 2 blocks of each other. Respect other's plots. Don't fill the whole district with shops! Instead, build roads and pathways!

6. **Chat Policy**: *Spamming* in chat is **not** allowed. *Excessive swearing* is **not** allowed. Do **not** *insult* other players. Severe action can be taken if you are reported. Our server has *team chats*. These are relatively unmoderated. Please read the guide on **Teams** for more information. This extends to voice chat's using the Proximity Chat system on Derpitcraft.
   
7. **Spectator Account Policy**: Spectator accounts will not be allowed this season, except for special cases. If you need a spectator account for any reason, please raise a ticket. Players can use the Replay mod (https://www.replaymod.com/) to create time-lapse's, etc. as an alternative. It is recommended to use this mod.
   
8.  **Resource Pack Policy**: **Cheating** respource packs are not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, **X-RAY** resource packs.You can only use normal resource packs. If we detect you as using a resource pack that gives you an unfair advantage, we can take action.  Let us know if you are using a resource pack in #ds9-general.

9.  **Clients, Mods, and More Policy**: The following lists *allowed* modifications to the game. Anything else should be considered not allowed. Raise a ticket if you are unsure.

    1.  Badlion Client, Lunar, Salwyrr, TLauncher and the official Minecraft Launcher are allowed. *Ask permission in a ticket for other clients*.
    2. Xaero's minimap with **FAIR play mode ON**.
    3. miniHUD Mod
    4. Replay Mod 
    5. Optifine
    6. Multiple fabric performance enhancing mods are allowed. A comprehensive list of these cannot be made. If you think a mod will not be allowed, *raise a ticket* before using it.

    **Important**: Gamma and full-bright are **not allowed**.

    Derpitcraft recommends using one of two **optional Fabric modpacks**. These enhance client-side performance. They are available at https://tinyurl.com/ds9modpack. Both of these packs include *simple voice chat*. There is a lite version and a normal verison. The lite version is considerably smaller.

    **Proximity Chat System**: Derpitcraft has a proximity chat system powered by the *simple voice chat* mod. Download this mod from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat to play with Proximity Chat on Derpitcraft. It is optional. To read more on how to use this system, read the guide on it below.

10. **IGN Policy**: We **DON'T** support changing your IGN mid-season. We are a **cracked server**, and you will **lose your items and player details** if you change your IGN. Do not change your IGN once you start playing with a specific IGN. *Raise a ticket if this is absolutely necessary.*

11.  **Lag Policy**: If you are experiencing lag, please wait a while for it to pass. If it stays and worsens, ping a moderator after **3 minutes** of continuous lag. Keep the following in your mind.

     - If you think you have died due to a lag spike/ TPS drop, we will require **videographic evidence** to confirm it and restore your items. Without video, we cannot restore your items.  
  
     - Remember, lag is both **server-side** and **client-side**. We can only compensate for **server-side** lag, and that also, to an extent. It is recommended to keep your X, Y, and Z coordinates on the screen at all times by either using a client-side Mod, or using the *coordinates HUD datapack* installed on the server (Read the how to guide on **commands** for more information).
  
     - This is a **server**, and all items will **despawn** after **5 minutes**, regardless of if you are online or not. The items may even despawn in chunks that you think are unloaded, but get loaded by somebody else. **It is recommended to assume that all items despawn after 5 minutes**. We cannot provide you your items back if they have despawned.

This list is ***not comprehensive***. If you think something may not be allowed, ask us by raising a ticket. If you have any other questions, please raise a ticket. The use of loopholes in these rules is not permitted, and will result in punishment. The say of the moderators is final in all cases. 

## Compatibility Issues on Bedrock

There might be a few compatibility issues with the server, since we support both Java and Bedrock. None of these issues pre gameplay. You may need to ask a Java edition player to *create maps*, etc. If you are experiencing issues with the server, please mention a moderator.

## A list of enhancements

1.  **Discord enhancements**: Multiple features have been added to discord. You can see images send in live chat in-game (on a map), see attachments as clickable links, and show your inventory on Discord by typing `[inv]` in the in-game chat. Along with this, we have added `/ender` and `/inv` slash commands on discord to show your inventory/ ender chest. Read the how to guide for more information on how to use these.

2. **Datapacks and Plugins**: Derpitcraft has a few quality of life datapacks (VanillaTweaks) and moderation plugins. These fit into your vanilla experience seamlessly. A list of relevant ones is given below. The How To guides contain information on how to use these.
   
    1. AFK Display (Turns your name gray and adds "AFK" suffix if you are inactive). Read more about the `/afk` command, and the AFK System in the How To Guides. 
    2. Armor statues (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV9-_RacnoI).

    6. Faster leaf decay after you chop logs.
    7. Mob's and Player's drop heads.
    8. You can silence mobs by naming them `silence me`.
    9. You see when and where villager's die on the server.
    10. All recipes are unlocked by default.

        2. You can craft single blocks into slabs. 
        3. You can craft droppers to dispensers.

        6. Blackstone can be used everywhere cobblestone is used. 
        7. You get more trapdoors, bark, stairs and bricks upon crafting. 
        8. You can unpack ice, nether wart blocks and wool. 
        9. You can craft and use **bundles** from leather.
    12. Several other custom commands have been added. These are all listed in the How To Guides

## How to guides

### Reporting Players

As a rule of thumb, try to resolve issues peacefully, without moderator intervention. If this doesn't work, report the player by raising a ticket (using `$rt`) and choosing "TrixMC" issue in the select menu. Please include the Player's IGN in your report if you can. It is important to take **screenshots** and even **video recordings** as evidence in some cases. If you feel like your issue is not adequeately solved by the moderators, ping **morpheus** directly.

### Teams and the AFK System

To declare a team, raise a ticket. In the ticket, you will be asked to mention who the team members are, and the preffered team colour and Minecraft Prefix that will show up in-game. Teams have slightly altered rules for slime chunks (see the next how to guide). A team can have a maximum of **8 members**.

To message within your team, use the `/teammsg <msg>` command in-game.

#### AFK System

If you are stationary for more than a set amount of time, you will automatically be put into the AFK team. You can't use `/teammsg` to chat while you are in the AFK team. To get out of AFK, just move around. 

You can also set yourself as AFK manually by using `/afk`. This will mark you as AFK for the benefit of everyone on the server.

### Getting Slime Chunks

Slime chunks are a fairly important part of the gain. Raise a ticket to get a slime chunk close to your coordinates.

#### Slime Chunk Limits

You can't get an inifinte number of slime chunks. The limits imposed are as follows:

- For a team size of 1-3 players: 1 slime chunk.
- For a team size of 4-7 players: 2 slime chunks.
- For a team size of 8 players: 3 slime chunks.

### Commands 

#### Custom Discord Commands

- `/ender` and `/inv` slash commands on discord to show your inventory/ ender chest. To use these commands, you have to run the in-game command `/discord link`. This will then link your Discord Account to your Minecraft account and enable these commands.
- `/getdcignof`, `/getdiscordof` commands to get the IGN and Discord of a user from their Discord or IGN respectively.

#### Custom In-game Commands

- `/playtime`: Get how much you have played on Derpitcraft.
- `/ifinvis`: Make an item frame invisible. Look at the item frame while running this command
- `/cohud` - Show coordinates HUD.
- `/sdinfo` - Show information about the Shopping District.
- `/afk` - Go AFK on Demand. Explained earlier.
- `/trigger nc_inNether`: Converts current coordinates to overworld coordinates. Can be used as a way to efficiently calculate coordinates for portals.
- `/trigger nc_inOverworld`: Converts current coordinates to nether coordinates.Can be used as a way to efficiently calculate coordinates for portals.
- `/aboutdc`: Shows information about Derpitcraft.

### Using Proximity chat (Super Voice Chat)

Derpitcraft has a proximity chat system powered by the *simple voice chat* mod. You can download this mod from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat to play with Proximity Chat on Derpitcraft. It is optional. This system can only work with Java clients. We recommend Bedrock clients use Discord.

Once you have downloaded the mod, it should work out of the box. Read more about the mod on it's wiki (https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/overview). There are very detailed explanations available. If you still do not understand how to use this mod, or it doesn't work, raise a ticket.

You can also join voice chat "groups". This is an easy way to voice chat between a group of players. This is recommended for teams. You can password protect these groups from the interactive creation wizard.

### DCCoordinates and Claims

Derpitcraft has a rudimentary claims system. As explained earlier, claims are done based on mutual respect. To make it easier for you, we have a #ds9-coordinates channel. This channel is updated by our bot.

To update and add your coordinates to this channel, you can use the `/dccoordinates` command. After this, you can enter in the type of structure the coordinates are for, the X, Y, and Z coordinates, and a name for the structure. You can also choose to register coordinates for your TEAM as a whole, or for only you. Use the team feature if you want to register coordinates for your team!

The coordinates get updated and posted into the dccoordinates channel. These coordinates also help us keep track of where someone's base is located. Always keep track of where your claims are located to make solving issues easier. These coordinates may be required in tickets.
