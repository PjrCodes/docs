# TrixMC Anarchy

## Introduction

TrixMC Anarchy, our own vanilla, no cheats, safe, anarchy server. TrixMC anarchy is compatible with Java 1.19.4 Cracked, Premium and  Bedrock clients. The server does not have any whitelist and will be free to play for all.

## A few guidelines  

Although an anarchy server means "no rules", in order to maintain a fun and safe environment for all players, we have layed down some rules.  

1. No lag machines or deliberate overuse of server resources.
2. No use of hacked clients, external programs, X-Ray texturepacks or radar.
3. No doxxing. Releasing personal information on another user without their consent is strictly prohibited, and will result in a permanent ban in both the server and the discord.
4. Chat needs to follow the same rules as the Discord server. [Rules](#chat-rules)

## chat rules

While in-game or on the discord server, the rules for chat are same as those on the discord server. They are:

1. Be respectful and kind. Treat all members with respect and express your thoughts appropriately.

2. Use English only. Communicate in English only, it makes it easier for us to communicate.

3. Do not spam. No excessive repeated messages, attachments, emoji, commands, mentions, broken messages. Do not use CAPITALS extensively. Don't mention anyone unnecessarily! Ghost pings are not appreciated and can result in a warning!

4. Self-promotion or advertisements. You can promote your creations, including but not limited to artwork, songs, social-media, and games. Sharing other discord servers, social-media, and other such unsolicited links is not permitted, in chat or direct messages.

5. No harassment, abuse, or bullying. We have zero-tolerance for harming others. Do not excessively use swear words. 
If you have a problem with the words being used on the server, please raise a ticket (see below for instructions).

6. No racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ+, or otherwise offensive speech. We do not tolerate hate speech. We want all groups to thrive on our server. Raise a ticket if any such behavior is seen.

7. No political or religious topics.

8. No piracy, sexual, NSFW, or otherwise suspicious content. We do not accept illegal or suspicious discussions and activity. If you think something suspicious is taking place, mention a staff member immediately.

9. Ban/ Warn/ Mute evasion. If ban’s, warn’s and mute’s are evaded by the use of alt accounts/ similar methods, we will take relevant action.

### Rule of Thumb

Rules are subject to common sense. Use common sense at all times! These rules are not comprehensive and the use of loopholes is subject to persecution.

### Some More Details

Follow Discord's TOS. Discord Community Guidelines apply! Ask a moderator for more details if you do not know what these are.

Use the channels as appropriate: Channel names and topics will indicate the subject of the channel.

Use an appropriate name, avatar and status. Avoid names, nicknames, avatars and statuses that do not follow the other rules listed here. Keep your nickname or username easily mentionable!

Please do not ask for roles/ ranks or any other such entity

Voice Channel Limitations: No "ear-rape" songs/ audio. "ear-rape" includes songs that at regular device volume cause pain and/or inconvenience to other users. This doesn't include songs that are disliked by some, and hence is not an excuse to skip songs. If a user is not sure whether a song is "ear-rape" or not, they can ask a staff member for clarification.

Protect your privacy and the privacy of others. Please do not share personal information more than you want to. Do not share address(es), phone number(s), etc.
